"# Java-DB-Connectivity" 

This is my first big project created, in an attempt to share my knowledge with databases and java. It features the use of CRUD methods, one to one, one to many and many to many relationships and the implementation of a GUI.

The project itself mirrors a simplified healthcare database, which is why I called the project "Simply Healthy." 

#Technologies used 
language - java
GUI Impelementation - javaFX
database - sql 
automation tool - maven
